# Catalog Bundle Tool

A command-line interface tool and library to consult Catalog.bundle files used by Unity games with the Addressables package.  
Very early version, only tested on Fire Emblem Engage. It should, however, be usable on other games.

Use the ``-h`` argument for a list of supported commands.
